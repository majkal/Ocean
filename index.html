                        When you really think about it, 150 meters is quite deep. But there’s a ton of activity that happens in this small portion of the ocean. This tends to be the territory that’s most familiar to us. It harbors more of our favorite sea creatures (blue whales tend to hunt at around 100 meters) and is the area we commonly explore on dives and in submarines. Most scuba divers don’t go deeper than 100 meters.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li class="event" data-depth="250 m">
                    <p>
                        The deepest known human freedive occurred at 253 meters — but don’t try it at home, as the pressure here is 26 times greater than it is near the surface of the ocean, and would crush most human lungs. This is also the part of the ocean that first introduced humans to deep-sea life: In 1960, the USS Triton became the first submarine to circumnavigate the earth at a depth of 213 meters.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li class="event" data-depth="500 m">
                    <p>
                        Down here, light is scarce and the pressure is high. Blue whales deepest known ventures take them to 500 meters, where they hunt for giant squid.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li class="event" data-depth="800 m">
                    <p>
                        This is the last sliver of ocean to see any signs of light. At 730 meters, standard submarines need to start heading back to the surface as this “danger zone” is full of oceanic pressure than can crush ill-equipped machines. By the time you reach 829 meters, you’re as deep as the height of the world’s tallest building, The Burj Khalifa. </p>
                </li>
                <li class="event" data-depth="1000 - 3000 m">
                    <p>
                        Yes, 1000 through 3000 is a huge span, but that’s because at these great depths, there isn’t a lot of excitement (that we know of). Beginning at around 1000 meters, you’re entering the “Midnight Zone” — where no sunlight reaches. There is still plenty of life here, particularly around undersea volcanoes. And even a few mammals venture down here. The known record for the deepest a mammal has ever swam is held by the Cuvier Beaked Whale, which has been known to descend to a staggering 2990 meters. </p>
                </li>
                <li class="event" data-depth="3800 m">
                    <p>
                        This dark and cold territory is certainly only conducive to a select few types of life (a few of them being fangtooths, dumbo octopi and hagfishes). The water here hovers near freezing, and the surrounding pressure is a whopping 378 times greater than at the surface. Sadly, this is also where the “Unsinkable Ship” now rests… The Titanic’s resting place is at a depth of 3800 meters.

                <li class="event" data-depth="10910 m">
                    <p>
                        Believe it or not, humans actually have ventured as far as just a few hundred feed shy of the ocean floor. But first, a comparison: If you turned Mt. Everest upside down, at 8848 meters, it would still be 2130 meters shy of the deepest part of the ocean, in the Mariana Trench. Director James Cameron descended to 10898 meters as part of the Deepsea Challenger Mission, and scientists Jacque Piccard and Don Walsh plummeted to 10910 meters in their 1960 Challenger Deep Mission.
